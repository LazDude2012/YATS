Yes, yes, I know this isn't where Minecraft expects the textures to be; it's not where I store them either.
This is for *you*, fine denizens of the Intertubes, to modify and use these textures. Also for my build script.
But mostly for you. :) To use them, put the "blocks" and "items" folder in src/minecraft/mods/YATS/textures.
That is all.
