Yes, yes, I know this isn't where Minecraft expects the textures to be; it's not where I store them either.
This is for *you*, fine denizens of the Intertubes, to modify and use these textures. Also for my build script.
But mostly for you. :) To use them, put the "blocks", "items", and "gui" folders in
src/minecraft/assets/lazdude_yats/textures.
That is all.
